This feature folder will contain the checkout flow.

Planned files (incremental):
- CheckoutPage.vue – form for receiver/shipping/payment + summary
- OrderSuccessPage.vue – success screen with order id and summary
- components/ – smaller presentational parts (FormSection, InlineError, etc.)
- composables/ – checkout-specific hooks if needed

Note: We intentionally keep these isolated here to avoid touching existing pages until integration steps.
